// THIS AND SUPER
/*
    this = "me, the current object".
    Use it when:
    Your method/constructor input has the same name as your variables.
    You want to clearly call your own methods.
    You want to call another constructor in the same class.
 */

/*
    The main benefit of this() in constructors is:
    ✅ Avoiding repetition & centralizing initialization
    Instead of writing the same initialization logic in multiple constructors,
    You can write it once in a “main” constructor,
    And make all other constructors redirect to it with this(...).
