 ðŸ’¡ Real-world analogy:

 Class = "Blueprint of a house".
 Object = "Actual house built using that blueprint".
 You can build many houses (objects) from the same blueprint (class), each with different paint color, size, etc.




 1. Class in Java

A class is a blueprint (or template) from which objects are created.
It groups data (variables/fields) and behavior (methods/functions) together.

 Think of it like a blueprint of a car:

It doesnâ€™t represent a car itself, but describes what a car has (wheels, engine)
and what it can do (drive, brake).
From that blueprint, you can create many actual cars (objects).


ðŸ‘‰ Definition:

A class in Java is a user-defined data type that contains fields
(variables) and methods (functions) to define the properties and behavior of objects.




 2. Objects in Java

A class is just a blueprint.

An object is the real-world entity created from that blueprint.
Objects represent instances of a class.

ðŸ‘‰ Definition:

An object in Java is an instance of a class that has its own state (variables/fields)
and behavior (methods).
